# Celo Composer Subgraph

## Requirements

- [The graph cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphprotocol/graph-cli)
- Contracts deployed with Hardhat with deployment information saved in `packages/hardhat/deployments/hardhat_contracts.json`
- Run `yarn get-abi` to print contract info and save ABI to `packages/subgraphs/abis`. Enter the network that the contract you want to watch is deployed at, and the name of your contract. This script reads the hardhat deployment info from `packages/hardhat/deployments/hardhat_contracts.json`.

This README was created following [this post](https://docs.celo.org/blog/using-the-graph). Consult it for more detailed information.

## Setup

Run

```bash
graph init
```

- Select `ethereum` as the protocol.
- Select `hosted-service`
- Name your subgraph following the convention `github-username/subgraph-name`
- Select `celo-alfajores` as the network (or `celo` for mainnet)
- Enter the appropriate contract address (printed when you ran `yarn get-abi`)
- Enter the path to the ABI (also printed when you ran `yarn get-abi`)

`cd` into the new directory

Run

```bash
graph codegen
```

- Create an account at https://thegraph.com/hosted-service.
  - Find more information about deploying a subgraph to the hosted service on the Graph docs [here](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/hosted-service/deploy-subgraph-hosted/#create-a-hosted-service-account).
- Authorize your cli 

```bash
graph auth --product hosted-service <ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

## Deploy

```bash
graph deploy --product hosted-service <GITHUB_USER>/<SUBGRAPH NAME>
```

It will take some time for the Graph to sync your subgraph. You can view the progress on the Graph's hosted service dashboard.

## Reference

You can view an example subgraph mapping, schema and subgraph manifest file in the `./storage-subgraph` folder. Note that this folder is missing the autogenerated files that the `graph` cli tool generates when you go through the steps above.
